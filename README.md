# MoltenPool2D-Dataset-for-Laser-Welding

The study aims to construct a high-quality continuous frame image dataset of laser welding to support the research of automatic welding state detection in intelligent laser welding. The data set is collected by our self-built welding platform and a high-resolution industrial camera. All the data are collected, processed and extracted from 138 real laser welding sessions.

This dataset focus on penetration state identification and prediction in laser welding process by analysing the image and video of molten pool and plasma in welding process.
